    You can see, in order to create a sequence that does not repeat, it has to be non-decreasing.
    Thus, we can think of dp: 
    dp[i][j] is no of sequences start with j or more that i has.

    dp[4][4] = 1 (the sequence is itself)
    dp[4][3] = 1
    dp[4][2] = dp[2][2] + dp[4][3]
        sequence format: 2 ... (numbers >= 2, total is 2)
    dp[4][1] = dp[3][1] + dp[4][2]
